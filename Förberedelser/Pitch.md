# Why did we choose this project?

It was a fun application which can be used at social events and parties.
We thought that this idea had been done before, however, we believe that we could improve on quiz applications and make them more interactive.
We wanted to solve the problem of having a social evening with everyone playing on their phones instead of being social. 
We thought that instead of using your phone for being on “Instagram” you could rather use it to be in a game and social together. 
(If you can’t beat them, join them).


# Sustainibility

We believe that this application can be used for a long time.
Everybody already has a mobile phone, we will be taking the mobile phone and making it more interactive and fun.
We believe that this application can be used for many different occasions.
